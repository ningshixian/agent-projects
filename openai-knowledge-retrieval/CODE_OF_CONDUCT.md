# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this project and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or
invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste,
color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and
healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the
  experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their
  explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project
team at [opensource@openai.com](mailto:opensource@openai.com). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem to
be in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – Private, written warning clarifying the nature of the violation and explaining
   why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** – Public warning for repeated or severe violations. The individual may be required to
   address the behavior directly with those affected.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Temporary removal from community spaces for behavior that violates the code.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from the project and community spaces for repeated or
   egregious violations.
